README.txt for cmap

This directory contains *.pickle.gz files converted from Adobe CMap resources.
CMaps are required to decode text data written in CJK (Chinese, Japanese,
Korean) language.  CMap resources are now available freely from Adobe web site:
https://github.com/adobe-type-tools/cmap-resources

The following files were downloaded from the following locations:

Adobe-CNS1-7/cid2code.txt:
	https://github.com/adobe-type-tools/cmap-resources/blob/master/Adobe-CNS1-7/cid2code.txt

Adobe-GB1-5/cid2code.txt:
	https://github.com/adobe-type-tools/cmap-resources/blob/master/Adobe-GB1-5/cid2code.txt

Adobe-Japan1-6/cid2code.txt:
	https://github.com/adobe-type-tools/cmap-resources/blob/master/Adobe-Japan1-6/cid2code.txt

Adobe-Korea1-2/cid2code.txt:
	https://github.com/adobe-type-tools/cmap-resources/blob/master/Adobe-Korea1-2/cid2code.txt


These *.pickle.gz files can be generated by running following commands in the
top directory:

    $ make cmap
    python tools/conv_cmap.py pdfminer/cmap Adobe-CNS1 cmaprsrc/Adobe-CNS1-7/cid2code.txt
    reading 'cmaprsrc/Adobe-CNS1-7/cid2code.txt'...
    writing 'CNS1_H.py'...
    ...

On Windows machines which don't have `make` command,
paste the following commands on a command line prompt:

    mkdir pdfminer/cmap
    python tools/conv_cmap.py -c B5=cp950 -c UniCNS-UTF8=utf-8 pdfminer/cmap Adobe-CNS1 cmaprsrc/Adobe-CNS1-7/cid2code.txt
    python tools/conv_cmap.py -c GBK-EUC=cp936 -c UniGB-UTF8=utf-8 pdfminer/cmap Adobe-GB1 cmaprsrc/Adobe-GB1-5/cid2code.txt
    python tools/conv_cmap.py -c RKSJ=cp932 -c EUC=euc-jp -c UniJIS-UTF8=utf-8 pdfminer/cmap Adobe-Japan1 cmaprsrc/Adobe-Japan1-6/cid2code.txt
    python tools/conv_cmap.py -c KSC-EUC=euc-kr -c KSC-Johab=johab -c KSCms-UHC=cp949 -c UniKS-UTF8=utf-8 pdfminer/cmap Adobe-Korea1 cmaprsrc/Adobe-Korea1-2/cid2code.txt
